### Welcome to the DroidBuilders Portal system

To allow us to get Public Liability Insurance (PLI) and also keep a good relationship with Lucasfilm/Disney, the UK R2 Builders Club put in place an MOT system to ensure that droids and their drivers are safe to operate in public places. (MOT is a UK test that is required for vehicles to be allowed on the road)

This software was put in place to keep track of all the details, as the original spreadsheet was getting out of hand.

Since the original version that just kept track of the MOT specific details, it has been expanded to become a portal for builders. Current features include:

* MOT
  * Add your droids
  * See your MOT status
  * Pay your PLI
* Events
  * See upcoming events
  * View Map of all upcoming events to see local ones
  * Register your interest in them
  * Get update emails if details change or admin broadcasts a comment
  * Save to calendar
  * Map to location for directions
  * Keeps track of events you've been to, along with any money raised for charity
* Achievements
  * Keep track of those special times, both good and bad. Things such as:
    * Weddings
    * School Visits
    * 232
    * Faceplant
    * Walk of Shame
* Parts Run
  * View current part runs
  * Register interest
