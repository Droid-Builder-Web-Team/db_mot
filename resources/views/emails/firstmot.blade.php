    <p>Congratulations on your first MOT.</p>
    <p>The MOT process is an important step in the UK, making sure that the droid is safe to be taken out in public and also will not run
        the risk of getting us in the bad books with the likes of Disney and LFL. With all the cameras and social media around these days, a
        run away droid will not look good!
    </p>
    <p>Thankfully, now that you've passed an MOT the risk of any of this happening is vastly reduced. To make sure we are covered we do have the club
        PLI policy.

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <p>Now that you've passed, here are the next steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a profile picture - This is required and will be used on your builders badge, so a head and shoulders shot is perfect.</li>
      <li>Pay your PLI - When you log into the Portal there should be a PayPal button at the top of your profile.</li>
      <li>Make sure you're happy with the droid pictures - You should have three pictures on your droid profile, front, side, and rear.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to an MOT officer. A list of them can be found in the MOT Info section.
