Welcome {{ $user->forename }} to the Droid Builders UK Portal.

The Portal is designed to help you keep track of club activities, along with the MOT status of your droids and your PLI payments.

Next steps:

Now that you've signed up, heres a few things you can do:

 * Add a profile picture - This will be used on your builders badge, so a head and shoulders shot is perfect
 * Add a droid - The original point of the portal is to keep track of your droids and their MOT status, so add any droids (complete or works in progress) and front/side/rear photos.
 * Give your droid a back story - For a bit of fun, give your droid a bit of a back story (or just copy it from Wookiepedia!).
 * Look for events - One of the best things to do is to attend events with your droids, look in the Upcoming Events for something you can attend, and register your interest
